## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am working full time as a frontend software engineer using React, but when I get a bit of time, I try to work on personal projects. 
- currently familiarising myself with NextJS

Recently finished project(s):
https://bookit-app-flax.vercel.app/
This is a conference room booking website using NextJS, with an authentication layer. It supports checking room availability and does not let the users have overlapping bookings.
